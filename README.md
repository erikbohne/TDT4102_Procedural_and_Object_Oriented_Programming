# TDT4102 Procedural and Object Oriented Programming
> Repository for the course [TDT4102 Procedural and Object Oriented Programming](https://www.ntnu.no/studier/emner/TDT4102#tab=omEmnet) at NTNU spring 2024.

## About
This repo will consist of all the assignments and projects I do during the course and lecture notes. I have previous experience with c programming from CS50 teached by David J Malan at Harvard University.

## Additional Information
The course uses a VSCode extention called **TDT4102 Tools**. This extention is made by the course staff and can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tdt4102.tools). The extention is used to download the required programs for the course and templates for setting up the projects.
